# HOOK NAME
#     pre-commit
#
# HOOK DESCRIPTION
#     Subversion runs this script prior to a commit. If this script exits
#     with 0, the commit is performed, otherwise rejected.
#     Currently this script checks if
#     - a non-empty log message is provided
#     - source files comply to our coding standard, i.e. if they have
#       been beautified before the commit.
#
# HOOK ARGUMENTS
#     Subversion passes the following arguments to this script:
#       $1 REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)
#       $2 TXN-NAME     (the name of the transcation about to be committed)
#      ***  NOTE: THE HOOK PROGRAM MUST NOT MODIFY THE TXN, EXCEPT  ***
#      ***  FOR REVISION PROPERTIES (like svn:log or svn:author).   ***
#
# HOOK CONFIGURATION
#     As subversion runs with an empty environment, you need to specify
#     absolute paths to applications awk, ..., tail. See below.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     This hook is just a multiplexer which calls numerous hooks from an
#     directory.
#     The hooks are executed in an temporary directory, with pre populated
#     files which hold information of the transaction.
