To run your application with Score-P just insert 'scorep --instrument' before
your actual compiler command, e.g. in your make file:
CC = scorep --instrument mpicc

After compiling run your binary as usual.

You can have a look on the trace file with the otf2_print tool:
otf2_print --anchor-file=scorep-***/traces.otf2
