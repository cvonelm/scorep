## AM_CPPFLAGS: The contents of this variable are passed to every compilation 
## that invokes the C preprocessor; it is a list of arguments to the 
## preprocessor. For instance, -I and -D options should be listed here.
##
## Automake already provides some -I options automatically, in a separate
## variable that is also passed to every compilation that invokes the C
## preprocessor. In particular it generates -I., -I$(srcdir), and a -I
## pointing to the directory holding config.h (if you've used
## AC_CONFIG_HEADERS or AM_CONFIG_HEADER). You can disable the default -I
## options using the nostdinc option.
##
## AM_CPPFLAGS is ignored in preference to a per-executable (or per-library) 
## _CPPFLAGS variable if it is defined.  So add it if necessary.
##
## -I$(srcdir)/../src: path to config.h; is this really necessary?
AM_CPPFLAGS = -I$(srcdir)/../src 

## Convenience variable, use for referencing sources, e.g.
## foo_SOURCES = $(SRC_ROOT)src/foo/foo.c. For CPPFLAGS use SRC_ROOT_*
## See the note below
SRC_ROOT = ../

## Convenience variables, use for referencing include directories,
## e.g.  foo_CPPFLAGS = $(AM_CPPFLAGS) -I$(INC_ROOT)src/bar
## -I$(INC_DIR_UTIL) -I$(PUBLIC_INC_DIR).
## Note: we need different convenience variable for SRC and INC
## because they are evaluated at different times. The SRC_ROOT
## variable is evaluated at autoreconf time where it is not
## recommended to use $(srcdir). On the other hand the INC_ROOT
## variable is evaluated during configure.
INC_ROOT = $(srcdir)/../
PUBLIC_INC_DIR = $(INC_ROOT)include
