Usage: scorep-score [options] <profile>
Options:
 -r          Show all regions.
 -h, --help  Show this help and exit.
 -f <filter> Shows the result with the filter applied.
 -c <num>    Specifies the number of hardware counters that shall be measured.
             By default, this value is 0, which means that only a timestamp
             is measured on each event. If you plan to record hardware counters
             specify the number of hardware counters. Otherwise, scorep-score
             may underestimate the required space.
 -m          Prints mangled region names instead of demangled names.
 -s <choice> Sorting of entries. Possible choices are totaltime, timepervisit,
              maxbuffer, visits and name (default=maxbuffer).
 -g          Generation of an initial filter file, has to be adapted to the
             application requirements. The name is 'initial_scorep.filter'.
 -b <%>      Only consider regions for the filter file that contribute more
             than <%> to the estimated memory requirements (SCOREP_TOTAL_MEMORY)
             (default 1%).
 -t <us>     Maximum 'time per visit' value in us that a region has to be below
             of to be included in the the filter file suggestion (default 1us).
