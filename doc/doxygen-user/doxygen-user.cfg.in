# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. Doxygen
# will adjust the colors in the stylesheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a colorwheel, see
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the
# value 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is
# blue, 300 purple, and 360 is red again. The allowed range is 0 to 359.

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts
# as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form "name=value".
# For example adding "sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n" will allow you to
# put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which
# will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading "Side Effects:".
# You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert newlines.
